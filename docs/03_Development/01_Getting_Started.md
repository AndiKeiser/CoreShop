# CoreShop

CoreShop is a Plugin for Pimcore. So it heavily depends on Pimcore itself. The most important things on how to develop with CoreShop are depending on Pimcore and its ecosystem. 

So, the most important documentation is there:

- [Old Pimcore-Wiki](https://www.pimcore.org/wiki/display/PIMCORE4/Pimcore+Version+4.x+Documentation)
- [New Pimcore Documentation on Github](https://www.pimcore.org/docs/latest/)
