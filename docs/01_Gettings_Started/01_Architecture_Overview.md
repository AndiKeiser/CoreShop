# CoreShop Architecture

CoreShops Bundles are build to be used individually. But, there is also a Bundle which combines all the Features: CoreBundle and AdminBundle.

As you can see, each Component/Bundle is seperate from each other. (Not totally, some have dependencies to others)

To see what each Bundles/Components responsability is, take a look here:

- [Bundles](../02_Bundles)
- [Components](../03_Components)
